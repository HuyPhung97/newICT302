                <h1> Welcome to Self and Peer Evaluation System (SPESys) 2.0 </h1>

                 <p> SPESys aims to provide efficient self and peer evaluation and make it simpler for both students and unit coordinators. </p>

                    <h1> For UC </h1>
                    <p> SPESys allows unit coordinators to create fully customisable SPE forms for their students in different units. To lighten the workload of the UCs, the system will calculate SPE scores base on the studentsâ€™ input after the deadline, capture it in a .csv file, and send that file to the UC. This spreadsheet can then be uploaded to LMS.  </p>

                    <h1> For student </h1>
                    <p> Students will be able to access their customised SPE forms through unique links generated and sent to their emails by the system. Students can then access this link to complete the SPE form and edit their submissions any time before the deadline. SPESys also features automated emails whereby an initial email will be sent 7 days before the deadline to notify the opening of the SPE form. Another notable feature is the warning email that will be sent to students that have yet to complete their forms 1 day before the deadline.</p>
